# pre_trained_vla_test

Runs `lerobot/pi05_libero` (PI0Policy) against an SO-101 arm simulated in Isaac Sim. Camera frames and joint states are consumed over ROS2; joint commands are published back to the sim.

Two ways to run inference:

- **Single-node (`pi0_inference`)** — everything (ROS2 + policy + GPU) runs on the same machine as Isaac Sim.
- **Broker/server (`pi0_inference_broker` + `pi0_inference_server`)** — splits inference onto a remote GPU machine while Isaac Sim and ROS2 stay local. See [Broker/server (remote GPU) setup](#brokerserver-remote-gpu-setup) below.

## Prerequisites

- Isaac Sim running with the SO-101 camera action graph publishing:
  - `/wrist_camera/image_raw`
  - `/base_camera/image_raw`
  - `/joint_states`
- ROS2 Jazzy installed
- LeRobot venv (includes torch) installed
- A GPU available for inference (locally for the single-node setup, or on a remote machine for the broker/server setup)

## HuggingFace Access

PI0Policy uses PaliGemma as its vision backbone, which is a **gated model** requiring license acceptance.

1. Accept the license at [huggingface.co/google/paligemma-3b-pt-224](https://huggingface.co/google/paligemma-3b-pt-224)
2. Generate an access token at [huggingface.co/settings/tokens](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens)
3. Export it in your shell (add to `~/.bashrc` to make permanent):

```bash
export HF_TOKEN=hf_...
```

Without this, the node will crash with a `403 Forbidden` error when loading the model.

## Quantising pi0_base to FP16

`lerobot/pi0_base` ships as FP32 (~13 GiB), which exceeds the VRAM of inference-class GPUs like the Tesla T4. Run the quantisation script once on any machine with >14 GiB RAM (no GPU required) to produce a FP16 checkpoint (~6.5 GiB):

```bash
python src/pre_trained_vla_test/pre_trained_vla_test/quantize_pi0.py
```

This saves a complete checkpoint to `~/checkpoints/pi0_base_fp16/`. The inference node is already configured to load from this path. To use a different output location:

```bash
python src/pre_trained_vla_test/pre_trained_vla_test/quantize_pi0.py --output /path/to/pi0_base_fp16
```

**You must update the model quantization** to `bfloat16` in the `/path/to/pi0_base_fp16/config.json` from `float32`, `float16` is **not** a supported option here.  

Then update `_MODEL_ID` in `pi0_inference.py` to match.

## Usage (single-node)

### 1. Source ROS2

```bash
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
```

### 2. Activate the LeRobot venv

```bash
source ~/lerobot/.venv/bin/activate   # adjust path to your venv
```

### 3. Build and source the package

```bash
cd ~/repos/isaac-sim-ros2-experimentation
colcon build --packages-select pre_trained_vla_test_interfaces
colcon build --packages-select pre_trained_vla_test
source install/setup.bash
```

### 4. Run the inference node

Run directly with the venv's Python rather than `ros2 run` — `ros2 run` uses the system interpreter which doesn't have the lerobot dependencies:

```bash
python install/pre_trained_vla_test/lib/pre_trained_vla_test/pi0_inference
```

The node will download `lerobot/pi0_base` from the Hub on first run (requires internet access), then begin publishing to `/joint_command` once all camera and joint state topics are live.

### Overriding the task prompt

```bash
python install/pre_trained_vla_test/lib/pre_trained_vla_test/pi0_inference --ros-args -p prompt:="place the cup on the plate"
```

### Using delta actions

If your VLA outputs per-step joint deltas instead of absolute positions, pass `delta_actions:=true`. Each chunk is integrated from the joint state captured at inference time, so the whole chunk is self-consistent regardless of feedback latency.

```bash
python install/pre_trained_vla_test/lib/pre_trained_vla_test/pi0_inference \
  --ros-args -p delta_actions:=true
```

Default is `false` (absolute joint positions).

### Using a LoRA fine-tuned model

Two workflows are supported depending on how your adapter was saved:

**LeRobot training checkpoint** (`lerobot-train --peft.method_type=LORA`): the checkpoint directory already contains the merged weights. Just point `_MODEL_ID` at the checkpoint and omit `lora_adapter_path`.

**Raw PEFT adapter directory** (contains `adapter_config.json` + `adapter_model.safetensors`): keep `_MODEL_ID` pointing at the base model and pass the adapter directory as a ROS param. The adapter is merged into the base weights at startup so there is no inference overhead.

```bash
python install/pre_trained_vla_test/lib/pre_trained_vla_test/pi0_inference \
  --ros-args \
  -p prompt:="place the cup on the plate" \
  -p lora_adapter_path:="/home/ubuntu/checkpoints/my_lora_adapter"
```

## Topics (single-node)

| Direction | Topic | Type |
|-----------|-------|------|
| Subscribe | `/wrist_camera/image_raw` | `sensor_msgs/Image` |
| Subscribe | `/base_camera/image_raw` | `sensor_msgs/Image` |
| Subscribe | `/joint_states` | `sensor_msgs/JointState` |
| Publish | `/joint_command` | `sensor_msgs/JointState` |

## Broker/server (remote GPU) setup

If the machine running Isaac Sim doesn't have a GPU (or you want to keep the sim machine free of the lerobot/torch stack), split inference across two nodes connected over the network:

- **`pi0_inference_server`** — runs on the remote GPU machine. Loads the policy once and serves the `pre_trained_vla_test_interfaces/srv/GetActionChunk` service. Stateless with respect to ROS topics — it never subscribes or publishes anything itself.
- **`pi0_inference_broker`** — runs locally alongside Isaac Sim. Subscribes to the camera/joint-state topics exactly like the single-node setup, but instead of running inference itself, JPEG-encodes the latest frames and calls `/get_action_chunk` on the remote server whenever its local action queue runs dry. Republishes the returned chunk to `/joint_command` at `30 Hz`, same as the single-node node.

Both nodes need ROS2 with the same `ROS_DOMAIN_ID` (or otherwise routable DDS discovery) so the broker can reach the server's service over the network. Images are JPEG-compressed before crossing the network to keep bandwidth low.

### 1. On the remote GPU machine — start the server

```bash
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
source ~/lerobot/.venv/bin/activate
cd ~/repos/isaac-sim-ros2-experimentation
colcon build --packages-select pre_trained_vla_test_interfaces pre_trained_vla_test
source install/setup.bash

python install/pre_trained_vla_test/lib/pre_trained_vla_test/pi0_inference_server \
  --ros-args \
  -p model_type:=pi05 \
  -p prompt:="place the cup on the plate"
```

`model_type` is `"pi0"` or `"pi05"` (default `"pi05"`). Pass `model_path` to override the default checkpoint.

On startup the server warms the policy up with a few throwaway inferences before advertising the service, so the first real request reflects steady-state latency rather than the cold-start spike (CUDA kernel compilation, cuDNN autotune, allocator warmup).

While running, the server's terminal accepts the same `pause` / `resume` / `reset` commands as the single-node node. While paused or resetting it returns empty chunks (`status=PAUSED`); the broker holds its queue and resumes cleanly.

#### Real-Time Chunking (RTC)

RTC smooths the seam between consecutive action chunks by treating chunk generation as an inpainting problem: the new chunk is blended with the unexecuted tail of the previous one during the flow-matching denoising loop. It only helps when inference runs *asynchronously* alongside execution (the broker re-plans continuously instead of draining to empty — see below).

Enable it on the server and tune the two knobs as ROS params:

```bash
python install/pre_trained_vla_test/lib/pre_trained_vla_test/pi0_inference_server \
  --ros-args \
  -p model_type:=pi05 \
  -p prompt:="place the cup on the plate" \
  -p enable_rtc:=true \
  -p execution_horizon:=10 \
  -p max_guidance_weight:=10.0
```

| Param | Default | Meaning |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `enable_rtc` | `false` | Toggle RTC guidance on the server. |
| `execution_horizon` | `10` | How many steps of the new chunk are blended with the previous chunk. |
| `max_guidance_weight` | `10.0` | Upper bound on how strongly consistency with the previous chunk is enforced. |

The `inference_delay` (how many actions the robot consumes during one round trip) is **not** a server param — only the broker can observe it, so the broker predicts it, sends it with each request, and measures the actual value to refine the estimate. `enable_rtc` must be set on **both** the server (for guidance) and the broker (for the queue/leftover bookkeeping).

### 2. On the machine running Isaac Sim — start the broker

```bash
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
cd ~/repos/isaac-sim-ros2-experimentation
colcon build --packages-select pre_trained_vla_test_interfaces pre_trained_vla_test
source install/setup.bash

python install/pre_trained_vla_test/lib/pre_trained_vla_test/pi0_inference_broker \
  --ros-args \
  -p jpeg_quality:=80 \
  -p pre_request_delay_sec:=2.0
```

The broker doesn't need the lerobot venv — it has no torch/policy dependency (the RTC queue is a small numpy implementation), so `ros2 run` works fine here (unlike the inference nodes). It accepts the same `pause` / `resume` / `reset` commands in its own terminal.

To run with RTC, enable it on the broker too:

```bash
python install/pre_trained_vla_test/lib/pre_trained_vla_test/pi0_inference_broker \
  --ros-args \
  -p jpeg_quality:=80 \
  -p enable_rtc:=true \
  -p initial_inference_delay:=4 \
  -p delay_ema_alpha:=0.3
```

| Param | Default | Meaning |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `enable_rtc` | `false` | When true, the request thread re-plans continuously (never drains to empty) and tracks the leftover/delay for RTC. When false, uses the legacy drain-then-request behaviour gated by `pre_request_delay_sec`. |
| `initial_inference_delay` | `0` | Starting guess (in action steps) for `inference_delay`, used until the EMA has seen real round trips. |
| `delay_ema_alpha` | `0.3` | Smoothing factor for the measured-delay EMA (higher adapts faster). |

With RTC enabled the broker measures `inference_delay` empirically: it records the queue cursor when a request goes out and again when the response arrives — the difference is exactly how many actions the robot executed during the round trip (network + server + GPU). That folds into the EMA used to predict the next request's delay. If a chunk comes back empty (server paused/resetting) the broker never merges it, lets the queue drain, and holds the last commanded position until chunks resume.

### Topics & service (broker/server)

| Node | Direction | Name | Type |
|------|-----------|------|------|
| Broker | Subscribe (local) | `/wrist_camera/image_raw` | `sensor_msgs/Image` |
| Broker | Subscribe (local) | `/base_camera/image_raw` | `sensor_msgs/Image` |
| Broker | Subscribe (local) | `/joint_states` | `sensor_msgs/JointState` |
| Broker | Publish (local) | `/joint_command` | `sensor_msgs/JointState` |
| Broker → Server | Call (remote) | `/get_action_chunk` | `pre_trained_vla_test_interfaces/srv/GetActionChunk` |

## Notes

- Inference runs at ~5 Hz; joint commands are published at 30 Hz from the action chunk (matching the dataset recording fps)
- The node waits silently until all four subscribed topics have published at least one message before running inference
- Call `policy.reset()` between task episodes — currently this happens automatically on node startup; add a ROS2 service call here if you need mid-session resets
- Camera key names (`wrist_camera`, `base_camera`) may need to be aligned with the keys `lerobot/pi05_base` was trained on — check the model card if inference errors on unrecognised observation keys
